# Chapter 1: Introduction to Statistics
Statistics facilitates the use of data to understand our world[^1]. The fundamental goal of statistics is to combine data as efficiently as possible. Say you have three measurements of your height - how do you use them to best approximate your true height? Do you pick your favorite? Do you take the average? Do you take the largest number? 

# Measurements

## What is a measurement?

## Combining multiple measurements
